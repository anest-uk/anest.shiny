### üöÄ **Why Can't We Solve the IV Estimator for \( \hat{\beta} \) in Closed Form?**

You're asking an excellent question. Let's take this step-by-step.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ The IV Estimator Formula**
We write the **instrumental variables (IV) estimator** as:

\[
\hat{\beta} = (Z'X)^{-1} Z'Y
\]

where:
- **\( Y \)** = Base period prices.
- **\( X \)** = Later period prices (zero-filled except for two nonzero entries per row).
- **\( Z = \text{sign}(X) \)**, containing only \( \pm1, 0 \).

At first glance, this looks like a **closed-form solution**, because it‚Äôs simply:

\[
\hat{\beta} = A^{-1} b
\]

where \( A = Z'X \) and \( b = Z'Y \).

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ The Hidden Non-Linearity**
The problem arises because **\( X \) itself depends on \( \hat{\beta} \)**.

Expanding \( X \):

\[
X_{jt} = P_{jt} \cdot Z_{jt}
\]

but the second price in a repeat sale is:

\[
P_{jt} = P_{j0} \cdot \beta_t
\]

substituting this into \( X \):

\[
X_{jt} = P_{j0} \cdot \beta_t \cdot Z_{jt}
\]

which means **\( X \) contains \( \beta \) implicitly**.

Now, our IV estimator equation:

\[
\hat{\beta} = (Z'X(\hat{\beta}))^{-1} Z'Y
\]

actually **contains \( \hat{\beta} \) inside \( X \)**. This makes the equation **nonlinear in \( \beta \)**.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why This Prevents a Closed-Form Solution**
Normally, for a closed-form solution, we require a system of **linear** equations:

\[
A \hat{\beta} = b
\]

which we can solve as:

\[
\hat{\beta} = A^{-1} b
\]

However, because **\( A = Z'X \) is a function of \( \hat{\beta} \)**, we cannot compute \( A^{-1} \) directly. Instead, we have an **implicit equation** for \( \hat{\beta} \):

\[
\hat{\beta} = (Z'X(\hat{\beta}))^{-1} Z'Y
\]

This means:
1. **\( \hat{\beta} \) appears on both sides**, preventing direct inversion.
2. We need an **iterative method** to solve for \( \hat{\beta} \), such as:
   - **Fixed-point iteration**
   - **Newton-Raphson**
   - **Nonlinear solvers like `nleqslv`**

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Summary**
‚úÖ **IV estimation normally allows a closed-form solution**.  
üö´ **But here, \( X \) depends on \( \beta \), making the system nonlinear**.  
‚ö° **Thus, we need numerical methods to solve for \( \beta \).**

---

### üöÄ **Next Steps**
Would you like to:
1. **See a Newton-Raphson implementation in R** for solving \( \hat{\beta} \)?  
2. **Compare iterative methods (e.g., fixed-point vs. Newton) for speed?**  
3. **Simulate different levels of measurement error to test IV robustness?**  

Let me know where you'd like to proceed! üöÄ

## ‚úÖ **The "Correct" Way to Compute \( \hat{\beta} \) in R**
Here are the **best numerical methods** ranked by stability:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Using `qr.solve()` (Recommended)**
QR decomposition is **more stable** than direct matrix inversion.
```r
beta_hat <- qr.solve(t(Z) %*% X, t(Z) %*% Y)
