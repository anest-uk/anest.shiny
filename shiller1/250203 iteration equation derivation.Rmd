### 📊 **Deriving the Non-Linear Case-Shiller Equations (General Case)**

You’ve pinpointed the heart of the issue: how do we get from the **normal equations** to the **non-linear system**, especially as the system scales?

---

### 🔑 **1. Starting Point: The Normal Equations (IV Estimator)**

The **IV estimator** is given by:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (Z'X)^{-1} Z'P
$$

Where:
- \( Z \) is the **instrument matrix** (with dummies \(-1, 0, 1\)).
- \( X \) is the **design matrix** (price-based).
- \( P \) is the vector of observed prices.

This leads to the **normal equations**:

$$
Z'P = Z'X \hat{\beta}
$$

Now, for a system with \( T \) time periods, \( \hat{\beta} \) is a \( (T-1) \)-dimensional vector, and \( Z'X \) is a \( (T-1) \times (T-1) \) matrix.

---

### 🔍 **2. Rearranging the Normal Equations**

Rearranging gives:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (Z'X)^{-1} Z'P
$$

To avoid explicitly inverting \( Z'X \), we can rewrite this as a **system of linear equations**:

$$
Z'X \hat{\beta} = Z'P
$$

For each time period \( t \), this expands to:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{T-1} (Z'X)_{tj} \hat{\beta}_j = (Z'P)_t
$$

Where:
- \( (Z'X)_{tj} \) represents the **interaction between instruments and prices** for time periods \( t \) and \( j \).
- \( (Z'P)_t \) is the **sum of instrument-weighted prices** for period \( t \).

---

### ⚡ **3. Introducing Non-Linearity**

Here’s where the **non-linearity emerges**:

- The matrix \( Z'X \) includes terms like **\( \hat{\beta} P \)** because the instruments interact with prices that depend on \( \hat{\beta} \) from other periods.
- When you expand the system, each equation for \( \hat{\beta}_t \) includes **products of \( \hat{\beta} \)** terms from different periods.

For example, with **2 periods**, we have:

$$
(Z'X) =
\begin{bmatrix}
  a_{11} & a_{12} \\
  a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\hat{\beta} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \hat{\beta}_1 \\
  \hat{\beta}_2
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
Z'P =
\begin{bmatrix}
  b_1 \\
  b_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Expanding:

$$
 a_{11} \hat{\beta}_1 + a_{12} \hat{\beta}_2 = b_1 \\
 a_{21} \hat{\beta}_1 + a_{22} \hat{\beta}_2 = b_2
$$

Now, because **\( a_{12} \)** and **\( a_{21} \)** depend on \( \hat{\beta} \), you get **recursive terms**:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{b_1 - a_{12} \hat{\beta}_2}{a_{11}} \\
\Longrightarrow \quad
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\text{Prices}}{\text{Prices + Adjustments involving } \hat{\beta}_2}
$$

This is exactly the non-linear structure you see in the Case-Shiller methodology.

---

### 🤯 **4. Scaling Up: Why This Gets Hard for 4+ Periods**

For \( T > 2 \):
- The system becomes a **coupled non-linear system**, with each \( \hat{\beta}_t \) depending on multiple other \( \hat{\beta} \)'s.
- You’d have to expand the matrix, isolate each \( \hat{\beta}_t \), and rearrange—**which quickly becomes algebraically intractable**.

For example, with 4 periods:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
  a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
  a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \hat{\beta}_1 \\
  \hat{\beta}_2 \\
  \hat{\beta}_3
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  b_1 \\
  b_2 \\
  b_3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Each \( a_{ij} \) includes terms that depend on \( \hat{\beta}_k \) for various \( k \), leading to **nested dependencies**.

---

### 🚩 **5. Why We Rely on Solvers**

- **No Closed-Form Solution:** The complexity of dependencies makes it impossible to isolate \( \hat{\beta}_t \) for each time period.
- **Numerical Solvers Handle This Naturally:**  
   - Solvers like `nleqslv` treat this as a **root-finding problem**.  
   - They iteratively adjust all \( \hat{\beta} \)'s simultaneously, respecting the system’s interdependencies.

This is why, beyond the simplest cases, we **abandon algebraic manipulation** and rely on **numerical solvers**.
