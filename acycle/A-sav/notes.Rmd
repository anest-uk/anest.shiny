**Acycle index**   
- This is an internal development version  
- These informal notes will be updated as development proceeds  
- The app is not self-explanatory at present and needs proper introduction  

**2024-12-29 Update**  
- extend the peer search stepwise up to 20 peers
- minimise error subject to a minimum data point constraint
- permit selection of entire area on the custom district tree
- page_navbar replaces tabsetPanel so the navigation headings remain fixed at the top

**2024-12-10 Update**  
- scan for peers based on Â£/m2 and radial distance and use best as defaults/peers in custom 
- report members of: suggested-peers-custom, selected-custom, computed-custom
- show custom-status: red message if selection not equal to computed, else black
- place actionbutton, member-report, custom-status above/outside scrolling area

**2024-11-25 Update**  
- promote from shinyapps.io free tier to 'basic' paid tier, enable 4GB memory for app
- add 'estimate custom' to avoid over-eager recalculation and hide it when selection=estimate
- add message 'custom index matches selection' when no re-estimation is needed
- listing: move districts from footnote to small header
- reorder custom selection alphabetically
- select target district using tree-picker widget

Limitations:
- target district treepicker should allow only one input - instead uses the first alphabetically
- target index treepicker causes error if area or region selected

**2024-11-20 Update**  
- add custom index district picker, always combined with target
- time-series summary: add custom index on all 6 displays
- time-series summary: outline custom districts orange on map
- listing: add custom index 
- accuracy: add custom index 
- custom index: compacted data, extend scope to all districts England & Wales
- formatting improvements
- performance issue: premature recalculation while typing in target district  
  
**2024-11-13 Initial**  
  
Geographic scope:  
  -  local indices
  -  current scope includes the local model, pre-calculated, on 104 postcode areas  
  -  most areas have been optimally split into 3 price-bands, smaller ones into 2 or just 1, depending on datapoints available  
  -  indices total 286 and span the country exactly: every property belongs to exactly 1 index  
  -  controls are (1) select district, AKA 'outward postcode', or 'outcode' (2) a 'base date' which is used to on the first page, displays 'indices' 'summary' and 'trade recap'  

 Limitations:  
  -  trade recap is available for area examples (BA, B, E, AL) only at present  
  -  the time-binning is as before dynamic bins currently 46 in total  
  -  accuracy is reported as 'mean square error' i.e. the error in the repeat sales regression  
  -  labelling is abbreviated and needs explanation  
  -  units are delta log price and are decimal  
  -  only one time-binning of 3 is displayed   
  -  only local geo-bins are displayed  
  -  sensitivity to outlier removal is reported but the resulting indices not shown  
  -  custom index is not implemented / not shown  
  -  upload and measure acccuracy of 3rd party index is not available  
  -  download index is not available  
  -  numerical results are not checked in detail  
  -  cycle model is not shown
